# 🎬 Rex: Your Personal Media Vault (Automation Tool)

## 📖 About This Project

In a world overflowing with content, it's often hard to keep up. We get so many amazing recommendations from friends, family, and online sources — for movies, TV shows, music, books, and podcasts — that we inevitably end up forgetting the things that once excited us.

That’s where **Rex** comes in — spelled R-E-X, a play on the word “recommendations.”

Rex is a lightweight, clean, and personal automation tool designed to solve that problem. It’s your private vault for cultural gems — making it effortless to quickly log, organize, and manage media suggestions so you never forget a great one again.
